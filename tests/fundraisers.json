    "description": "No one should have to wonder where their next meal will come from, spare #AThoughtForFood.  Khaana Chahiye Foundation started as a citizen-led campaign in March 2020 to meet the immediate, lockdown-induced food demands of the homeless, migrant workers, daily wage labourers, and other vulnerable populations in the city of Mumbai. A campaign that was powered by the city of Mumbai, was able to serve 66.5 lakh meals and distribute more than 70,992 grocery kits Our migrant relief operation served 6 lakh migrants travelling by railways and road at Mumbai’s 4 key exit points. We soon evolved into a volunteer-driven organization striving to eliminate the problem of hunger in the city.   Through our Hunger Map Project, we have used the latest technology and the wide network of volunteers and community leaders, who have been monitoring the situation on the ground for the past year. In the last few months, the COVID-19 cases have risen sharply, forcing the government to declare a partial lockdown which may soon be expanded to a full-fledged one.  Anticipating the acute food demand, we have begun by serving 2000 meals across micro-clusters and along Mumbai’s arterial roads. We have also tied up with Zomato Feeding India to expand our food distribution.",

    "description": "HASSAN: HBCU stands for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. After the Emancipation Proclamation, there was racial segregation, so a lot of these schools were founded during that time. Emancipation was in 1863, and Howard was founded in 1867. These schools were founded to educate and funnel former Black slaves into larger society.  Over time, HBCUs got bigger and started to offer regular classes and things like that. They started building traditions outside of larger America, and those traditions have lasted. These schools still produce a lot of Black professionals—Xavier produces a large number of Black doctors , North Carolina A&T engineers, Howard University business, and Law and Hampton for dentistry. They’re still very important and are traditionally underfunded, so it’s crucial that we make sure we give back to these schools that gave us so much.",
